# HatersBackOff
Bot that connects to an IRC and utilizes simple APIs from Twitter and OpenWeatherMap

Download file, open up in an IDE. Google search quakenet or any IRC (as long as you change the site), access their site and put in #HatersBackOff in the channel section. As soon as you create the room, run the bot and wait for the bot to connect then run the program and type "!help" for commands in the chat.

This bot can allow users to check on weather real time in the chat box and as well as see what's trending on twitter.

For the hackathon, the objective was to help decrease online harassment. So this bot detects certain key words in order to decrease cyberbullying. If the bot see's certain keywords it'll pop out a "Haters back Off", a link to a anti-harassment site (later), and a anti-harassment twitter post (later).
